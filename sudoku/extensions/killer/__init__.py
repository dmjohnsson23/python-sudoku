"""
Killer sudoku is a variant that contains "cages" in addition to the normal 
rows, columns, and squares.

Cages have a sum value listed in them, which all cells in the cage must add up to. 
Additionally, cells in cages are not allowed to have any repeated digits, even when
such would otherwise be allowed by normal sudoku rules.
